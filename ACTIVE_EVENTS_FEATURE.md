## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components

#### **ClubAdminDashboard.jsx Updates**
```javascript
// New state for active events
const [activeEvents, setActiveEvents] = useState([]);

// Fetch function for active events
const fetchActiveEvents = async () => {
  const eventsData = await eventApi.getAllEvents();
  const activeEventsData = eventsData.filter(event => 
    event.status === 'PUBLISHED' && 
    (event.startDate || event.endDate || event.location || event.maxParticipants)
  );
  setActiveEvents(activeEventsData);
};

// Render function for active events section
const renderActiveEvents = () => (
  <div className="active-events-section">
    <div className="active-events-grid">
      {activeEvents.map(event => (
        <div key={event.id} className="active-event-card">
          {/* Event card content */}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

#### **Handler Functions**
```javascript
// View event details
const handleViewEventDetails = (event) => {
  // Shows detailed event information
};

// Edit event using existing modal
const handleEditEvent = (event) => {
  setSelectedEvent(event);
  setShowEventModal(true);
};

// View registrations (placeholder)
const handleViewRegistrations = (eventId) => {
  // Future implementation for registration management
};
```

### CSS Styling

#### **Active Events Grid**
```css
.active-events-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(400px, 1fr));
  gap: 24px;
}
```

#### **Event Cards**
```css
.active-event-card {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95);
  backdrop-filter: blur(20px);
  border-radius: 20px;
  box-shadow: 0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  transition: all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
}

.active-event-card:hover {
  transform: translateY(-4px);
  box-shadow: 0 16px 48px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
}
```

## User Workflow

### 1. **Accessing Active Events**
- Navigate to Club Admin Dashboard
- Click "Active Events" tab (🎪 icon)
- View all published events with full details

### 2. **Viewing Event Details**
- Click "👁️ View Details" button
- See comprehensive event information in alert dialog
- Includes all event metadata and scheduling info

### 3. **Editing Events**
- Click "✏️ Edit Event" button

- Modify any event details (dates, location, description, etc.)
- Save changes to update the event

### 4. **Managing Registrations**

## Integration with Event Approval

### **Automatic Updates**
When an event proposal is approved:
1. Event status changes to 'PUBLISHED'
2. Event gets full details (dates, location, poster, etc.)
3. Active Events list automatically refreshes
4. Event appears in Active Events section

### **Data Flow**
```
Event Proposal → Approve → EventApprovalModal → API Call → 
Database Update → Refresh Active Events → Display in UI
```

## Event Filtering Logic

Active events are filtered based on:
- **Status**: Must be 'PUBLISHED'
- **Details**: Must have at least one of:
  - Start date
  - End date  
  - Location
  - Maximum participants

This ensures only fully detailed, approved events appear in the Active Events section.

## Responsive Design

### **Desktop (>768px)**
- Grid layout with multiple columns
- Full event cards with all details
- Horizontal action buttons

### **Mobile (≤768px)**
- Single column layout
- Stacked event information
- Vertical action buttons
- Optimized poster sizes

## Future Enhancements

### **Planned Features**
1. **Registration Management**: View and manage event registrations
2. **Event Analytics**: Participation statistics and insights
3. **Event Status Updates**: Mark events as completed, cancelled, etc.
4. **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple events for batch operations
5. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by date range, event type, club, etc.
6. **Export Functionality**: Export event data to CSV/PDF

### **Potential Improvements**
1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live updates
2. **Event Calendar View**: Calendar interface for better date visualization
3. **QR Code Generation**: Generate QR codes for event check-ins
4. **Social Media Integration**: Share events on social platforms
5. **Email Notifications**: Automated reminders and updates

## Error Handling

### **Empty States**
- Shows friendly message when no active events exist
- Provides guidance on how events appear in this section

### **Loading States**
- Loading indicator while fetching events
- Graceful handling of API failures with fallback data

### **Data Validation**
- Ensures event data integrity before display
- Handles missing or incomplete event information

## Performance Considerations

### **Optimizations**
- Efficient filtering of events client-side
- Lazy loading of event posters
- Debounced refresh operations
- Minimal re-renders with proper state management

### **Caching**
- Events data cached until manual refresh
- Automatic refresh only on relevant actions (approval, editing)

The Active Events feature provides a comprehensive solution for managing published events with an intuitive interface and powerful functionality for club administrators.
